## Defi Stablecoin

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Defi Stablecoin using the Solidity programming language. The stablecoin is designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar.

## Features

-   **Minting and Burning**: Users can mint new stablecoins by depositing collateral and burn stablecoins to withdraw collateral.
-   **Collateralization**: The stablecoin is backed by collateral (wETH, wBTC), ensuring that it maintains its value.
